Here is a simple Nike Sneaker Monitor that I made from a video I watched for in large part my Nike SNKR Bot, Botty that I plan on releasing earlier in 2022.
The program runs a simple script that scarpes Nike's site for links and turns into Dsicord notifiactions.
Later plans for this will include pre-relaease info that will include pricing, sizing, and regions that a user can purchase.
